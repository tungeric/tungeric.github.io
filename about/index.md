## Hello!
My name is Eric, and I am a software developer. Previously, I worked as a structural engineer, and I had a large hand in projects such as the [SF Moma Expansion](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNVu3krxp28WZ9X9l-GnWaItip4=/0x240:1998x1364/1200x675/filters:focal(0x0:1818x1364)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49437881/SFMOMA-4.0.jpg) and the [Sacramento Barn](http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/57/67/33/12547794/5/920x920.jpg).

Being a structural engineer was [rewarding in its own right](..//sf-moma-and-the-art-of-staying-in-love/), but while I was on that path I discovered my passion for programming. In 2017 I decided to swap my hard hat for a Macbook and began my journey as a software developer. Since then I've worked on honing my programming chops in new languages and frameworks, and I'm excited to bring my experience and everything I've learned  onto my next adventure.

In my spare time you can often find me chasing waterfalls, whether that's hiking outdoors under the blazing sun or in a dimly lit room getting my TLC impersonation on.
