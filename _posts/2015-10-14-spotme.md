Picture you just discovered this hot new restaurant in a popular part of town. You make a reservation and you drive up the night up eager for a night of great food and drink. Upon getting to your destination, however, you realize that there. Is. No. Parking.

Anywhere.

You turn off the main street onto a residential side street and you experience the all-too-familiar torment where every time you think you see an open spot you realize that it's only open because it's in front of a driveway. And you think "there has to be a better way!"

Well now there is! (Sort of.) Enter SpotMe!

SpotMe is a mobile application I'm working on in a team of 4 engineers starting in mid-October of 2017. We've 

# Feature Demo

## Facebook login

One of the first challenges I tackled for this project was O-Auth. O-Auth was much more complex than anything I had learned at App Academy thus far, and took much longer than I expected. Here's what the flow for the authentication ended up being for me:

1. I used a website called [Auth0](www.auth0.com) to help me with the process. Altogether, Auth0 didn't actually save me any steps, but because it was built to handle multiple logins through multiple sites all using a single endpoint from the developer perspective (meaning the process to add Google authentication would be theoretically minimal), it seemed to be the right way to go. The built-in debugger was very helpful in me figuring out where I was going wrong in my requests.

2. Using Auth0, I pinged Facebook for an access code. This is a short-ish code that you'll need for Step 3.

3. Facebook (and other websites - including Auth0!) have a Client ID along with a Client Secret that you have to keep, well, _secret_. I ended up storing this in the backend using the Figaro gem, in the `application.yml` file, so the next step is to ping our backend with the access code we got in Step 2, so Rails can ping Facebook for the actual authorization token.

4. Rails pings Facebook for the actual authorization token.

5. So Facebook sends you the authorization token back. We're done, right? NOPE. It gives you the token back in a Base64Url encoded format, which I then used the jwtDecoder library to decode. When the token is decoded, we finally have access to our Facebook information (email, profile, etc) and we can sign in to our app normally.

The result is glorious:
